# Elastic Net Regression

-> This project demonstrates **Elastic Net Regression**, a hybrid regularization technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties.  
-> It helps solve limitations of pure Lasso or Ridge by balancing coefficient shrinkage and feature selection.

## Contents:-
-> Elastic Net Regression using sklearn
-> Explanation of L1 + L2 combined penalty
-> Visual comparison with Lasso and Ridge
-> Effect of alpha and l1_ratio on model behavior
-> Coefficient plot for different regularization strengths

## Key Concepts:-
-> When to prefer Elastic Net over Lasso or Ridge
-> Bias–variance tradeoff with mixed penalties
-> How l1_ratio controls balance between L1 & L2

## Libraries Used:-
-> NumPy  
-> Pandas  
-> Matplotlib  
-> Scikit-learn
